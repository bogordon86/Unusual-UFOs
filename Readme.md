I created a basic HTML web page that uses my ufo dataset by converting it to a JavaScript object, and creates a data table with rows that contain UFO sightings.
* You can also search using multiple input tages for filtering the data based on the following table columns: 

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
